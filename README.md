- Configurable resolution (max 800px width) and bitrate (4Mbps default)
- Smooth 20 FPS display with optimized frame processing
- Support for multiple device connections simultaneously

### üéÆ Device Control
- **Mouse Control**: Click, drag, and scroll on the mirrored screen
- **Keyboard Input**: Full keyboard support for text input and shortcuts
- **Touch Gestures**: Native Android touch event simulation
- **Real-time Interaction**: Low-latency input response

### üì∏ Screenshot Functionality
- **Quick Screenshot**: Press `` ` `` (backtick) key to capture screenshots
- **Batch Screenshots**: Capture screenshots from all connected devices
- **Auto-save**: Screenshots automatically saved with timestamps
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for various image formats

### üîß Advanced Features
- **Multi-device Support**: Connect and control multiple Android devices
- **Responsive UI**: Modern Flet-based desktop interface
- **Device Auto-detection**: Automatic detection of connected Android devices
- **Connection Management**: Easy connect/disconnect device management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows/macOS/Linux support
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and configured

### Android Device Requirements
- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
- USB debugging enabled
- Screen recording permission granted

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d0-justice/nano-android.git
   cd nano-android
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup ADB**:
   - Install Android SDK Platform Tools
   - Add ADB to your system PATH
   - Enable USB debugging on your Android device

4. **Deploy scrcpy server** (automatic on first connection):
   ```bash
   adb push scrcpy/scrcpy/scrcpy-server.jar /data/local/tmp/
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Connect your Android device** via USB and enable USB debugging

2. **Verify device connection**:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8550`
   - The application will automatically detect and connect to available devices

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`` ` ``** (Backtick): Take screenshot of all connected devices
- **F1-F4**: Navigate between different views/devices
- **Mouse**: Click and drag for device interaction
- **Keyboard**: Type directly on the mirrored screen

### Screenshot Management

Screenshots are automatically saved with the following naming convention:
```
screenshot_[device_id]_[timestamp].png
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured through the `Config` class in `main.py`:

```python
class Config:
    WINDOW_WIDTH = 1200        # Application window width
    WINDOW_HEIGHT = 800        # Application window height
    LEFT_CONTAINER_WIDTH = 800 # Device view container width
    NODE_SIZE = 80            # UI element size
    # ... more configuration options
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Device not detected**:
   - Ensure USB debugging is enabled
   - Check ADB connection: `adb devices`
   - Try different USB cable or port

2. **Connection timeout**:
   - Increase connection timeout in device configuration
   - Restart ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

3. **Screen recording permission**:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted on device
   - Some devices require manual permission in Settings

4. **Performance issues**:
   - Reduce bitrate or resolution in client configuration
   - Close other applications using device resources

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=1
python main.py
```
